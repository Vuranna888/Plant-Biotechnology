                                The livestock contributes between 12-18 percent of all GHG emissions whilst simultaneously advancing global water issues, polluting and increasing scarcity (González et al., 2020).

                                Within meat, there are common contaminants that have several studies linking their consumption of greater risk of development of cancers, namely prostate cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer (Stephens et al. 2018).

                                    The market for impossible meat, or meat substitutes that hold similar nutritional value and taste is very large. Almost 360 million tonnes of meat was consumed by Australians alone in 2018, with this number being so large, it's easy to see the magnitude of the issue (Stephens et al., 2018).
                                </li>

                                Further than this, impossible meat also extends to other unsustainable industries, such as seafood. Over the last 5 years alone, the impacts of overfishing can be observed by the drastic decrease of almost 80 percent of commonly the consumed fish bluefin tuna and swordfish, indicating that a change is a necessity (Bardey, 2020).

                                Genetic engineering, the process of manipulating the genetic material of an organism to obtain an altered genotype, is the most commonly used technique to transform the taste, texture, and look of plant material in order to be similar to real meat (Van Vliet et al, 2020).

                                One important element of plant based meat is meeting nutrition standards. Pea, wheat and soy protein are included as a means of meeting protein levels on par with standard meat (Rubio et al., 2020).

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Future of This Biotechnology</h1>
        Upon researching, it is evident that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of this biotechnology. 
        The biggest hurdle to overcome will be the cost of this as a product, butm as this becomes more popular
        and more commercialised, we would expect that the cost of production and therefore sale will decrease. 
        If this were to happen, what we think is the biggest hurdle will be overcome. Overall, plant-based “impossible meat” 
        is a more environmentally, nutritionally and ethically produced alternative to meat from livestock. The reduced 
        risk of contamination and the transmission of zoonotic diseases that the killing of livestock presents, the 
        reduced use of water and land for the maintenance and feed of the livestock and therefore the reduction in methane 
        production are all factors that indicate a more sustainable industry for source of protein. This biotechnology 
        also indicates a foreseeable increase in accessibility to meat as the need for land, crops and water to sustain 
        livestock will be unnecessary.

                            Due to the unique way that meat feels in the mouth there are certain scientific techniques that are required
                            to replicate or at least attempt to replicate this texture with plant proteins and fats. Luckily for the sake
                            of the environment (and your physical health), plant proteins have a wide spectrum of functionalities such as
                            their ability to emulsify, stick together and hold essential amino acids that real meat does not (McClements, Grossman, 2021).
                            The most common type of plant proteins used in the production of plant-based meats are pea (including pulses), wheat, and soy
                            protein due to their wide availability and low production costs. For there to be an increased level of nutrients such as different
                            amino acids, proteins from rice and mung beans are also included in production (Sha, Xiong, 2020).  Plant fats such as coconut and
                            cocao oils are extracted and added to the protein mixture in clumps to mimic the appearance of blended animal fat in ground beef
                            burgers and enhance the mouthfeel of the product. To take plant-based meat to the next level, specifically products trying to imitate
                            beef; a heme protein extracted from the roots of certain plants called leghemoglobin is used to give the red colour and even gives off
                            a meat-like aroma when cooked, among other meaty characteristics (McClements, Grossman, 2021). Products that don’t use this compound
                            often use betalain, the natural pigment in beetroot to give a red colour.

                            When the plant-based meat industry takes off the implications will be huge. It will provide
                            many jobs including those for the farming of the crops associated with production of these
                            products and it will lead to a general improvement of the impact of the agricultural sector.
                            This will be due to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions such as the extremely potent methane,
                            it has been shown that beef production creates 60 times more greenhouse gases than the production
                            of peas does (Poore, Nemecek, 2019). The massive reduction in water usage during the production of
                            plant-based meats is also extremely beneficial, especially when considering the drought issues in
                            Africa and Australia. Unfortunately, according to Michel et al. (2021) meat alternatives are still
                            publicly viewed negatively. For now, the best thing producers of plant-based meats can do is continue
                            to work on the taste and appearance of their product whilst making the pricing competitive (Michel et al., 2021).

                                Smells corresponding to the olefactory sensations of buttery, smoky, meaty, sweet,
                                and roasted are different between real meat and plant based meat. When cooked, the different proteins,
                                carbohydrates, and fats release different compounds contributing to smell. This difference is very
                                difficult to match. A close match of these smells can be obtained by the use of protein containing non-volatile
                                compounds that give a planty or yeasty smell and natural flavors that can break down while being cooked
                                also mimics the smell of real meat.

                                The taste of plant based meat can be matched via the use of similar protein, carbohydrate, and
                                fat compounds similar to that of real meat. Soy protein mimics the taste of meat proteins very well. Natural or
                                artificial flavors further enhance the meaty flavors found in each kind of meat. Unsaturated fats are a major component in
                                that it can infuse several flavours and create a juicy and rich taste similar to that of meat.

                                The look of plant based meat is accomplished with several natural colours. A substitute for the red colour of muscle tissue in meat can be found in
                                root nodules of several plants. The root nodules have leghaemoglobin, another red pigment which mimics the look and taste of meat. Otherwise, pink and
                                red colours can be mimicked with pomegranate powder or beet extract.

                        to grow as the population inevitably increases. (Bhat et al., 2019). This is a very present issue in our
                        society. In recent years the idea of “impossible meat” has been raised. The advantages of impossible
                        meat have become evident as it has become more prominent in the food industry. The current and most
