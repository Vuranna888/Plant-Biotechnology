                                    The market for impossible meat, or meat substitutes that hold similar nutritional value and taste is very large. Almost 360 million tonnes of meat was consumed by Australians alone in 2018, with this number being so large, it's easy to see the magnitude of the issue.
                                </li>

                                Further than this, impossible meat also extends to other unsustainable industries, such as seafood. Over the last 5 years alone, the impacts of overfishing can be observed by the drastic decrease of almost 80 percent of commonly the consumed fish bluefin tuna and swordfish, indicating that a change is a necessity (Bardey, 2020).

                            Due to the unique way that meat feels in the mouth there are certain scientific techniques that are required
                            to replicate or at least attempt to replicate this texture with plant proteins and fats. Luckily for the sake
                            of the environment (and your physical health), plant proteins have a wide spectrum of functionalities such as
                            their ability to emulsify, stick together and hold essential amino acids that real meat does not (McClements, Grossman, 2021).
                            The most common type of plant proteins used in the production of plant-based meats are pea (including pulses), wheat, and soy
                            protein due to their wide availability and low production costs. For there to be an increased level of nutrients such as different
                            amino acids, proteins from rice and mung beans are also included in production (Sha, Xiong, 2020).  Plant fats such as coconut and
                            cocao oils are extracted and added to the protein mixture in clumps to mimic the appearance of blended animal fat in ground beef
                            burgers and enhance the mouthfeel of the product. To take plant-based meat to the next level, specifically products trying to imitate
                            beef; a heme protein extracted from the roots of certain plants called leghemoglobin is used to give the red colour and even gives off
                            a meat-like aroma when cooked, among other meaty characteristics (McClements, Grossman, 2021). Products that don’t use this compound
                            often use betalain, the natural pigment in beetroot to give a red colour.

                            When the plant-based meat industry takes off the implications will be huge. It will provide
                            many jobs including those for the farming of the crops associated with production of these
                            products and it will lead to a general improvement of the impact of the agricultural sector.
                            This will be due to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions such as the extremely potent methane,
                            it has been shown that beef production creates 60 times more greenhouse gases than the production
                            of peas does (Poore, Nemecek, 2019). The massive reduction in water usage during the production of
                            plant-based meats is also extremely beneficial, especially when considering the drought issues in
                            Africa and Australia. Unfortunately, according to Michel et al. (2021) meat alternatives are still
                            publicly viewed negatively. For now, the best thing producers of plant-based meats can do is continue
                            to work on the taste and appearance of their product whilst making the pricing competitive (Michel et al., 2021).
